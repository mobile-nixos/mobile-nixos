## Building

The stage-2 needs to be built natively on the target architecture (armv7 on
armv7, aarch64 on aarch64).

(Though the tooling will try to build it through cross-compilation!)

## :warning: Warning :warning:

This configuration includes patches to GNOME that are still very work-in-progress. For more info, please refer to this article: https://blogs.gnome.org/shell-dev/2022/09/09/gnome-shell-on-mobile-an-update/
