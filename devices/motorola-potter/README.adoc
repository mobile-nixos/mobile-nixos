=== Firmware for Wi-Fi

This particular phone keeps the firmware files on a partition named
`modem`.

To make use of the Wi-Fi capabilities of this phone you will need to
make them available to the firmware derivation.

The files can be acquired through different methods. You can use an
alternate recovery like TWRP, mount the partition (identified using
`blkid`) and copy the files.

Another way is to do it using an installed Mobile NixOS system, where,
too, you mount the partition and copy them:

```
$ sudo mount -o ro /dev/disk/by-partlabel/modem /mnt
$ cp -r /mnt ./modem
$ sudo umount /mnt
```

The copy of the firmware files will be in the modem directory, in the
current working directory, ready to be referred to.
