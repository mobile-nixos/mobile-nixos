== Device-specific notes

=== Platform Firmware

It is recommended to install link:https://tow-boot.org/[Tow-Boot] to
dedicated storage (mmcboot).

Mainline U-Boot should work, but Mobile NixOS is tested with Tow-Boot.

=== Installer

The installer can be downloaded and flashed to an SD card.

```
 $ dd if=mobile-nixos_pine64-pinephone_installer.img of=/dev/mmcblkX bs=8M oflag=sync,direct status=progress
```

When using Tow-Boot, hold _volume down_ during boot to boot from the SD card.

Follow the on-screen instructions to configure a basic system.


== Usage notes

=== LED

In the default setup, the LED has been configured to show status information.
Its colour or pattern can be used to infer the status.

During boot:

 * Green when the kernel initializes the LED driver

At any time after Linux booted:

 * The red LED will flash on panic

As it does not reset the other LED colours, it may flash green/yellow rather
than off/red. If applications customize the LED status, it may flash in other
patterns involving red.

=== Updating the boot image

The default suggested setup does not currently require updating the boot
partition.

include::_support/device-notes/boot-image.inc[]

==== Flashing the boot image

The resulting image can be flashed (dd) to the appropriate partition. With the
partition layout as made by the guided installer, this will be the fourth
partition on the main storage.


== Development notes

[NOTE]
====
*The following sections only apply for development.*

=== Building a full disk image

This platform uses the `u-boot` system-type. This means that a full disk image
can be produced, and this full disk image flashed _outright_ to the block
device. That block device can be the internal eMMC or the SD card.

The PinePhone will boot from SD card if a bootloader can be found. This means
that the full disk image can be flashed to an SD card, and it will prioritise
booting it.

```
 $ nix-build --argstr device pine64-pinephone -A outputs.disk-image
 $ dd if=result of=/dev/mmcblkX bs=8M oflag=sync,direct status=progress
```

=== Building the boot partition

Building the full disk image may require a native AArch64 system.

The boot partition can be built, and then flashed on top of an existing Mobile
NixOS boot partition.

```
 $ nix-build --argstr device pine64-pinephone -A build.boot-partition
 $ dd if=result/mobile-nixos-boot.img of=/dev/mmcblkXpY bs=8M oflag=sync,direct status=progress
```

=== Building U-Boot

Mobile NixOS is not managing platform firmware builds anymore.

We recommend installing link:https://tow-boot.org/[Tow-Boot] to dedicated storage
(mmcboot).
