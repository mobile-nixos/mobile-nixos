== Building

This will build the default output for your _<%= info["fullName"] %>_.

 $ nix-build --argstr device <%= info["identifier"] %> -A build.default

== Installation

The device will need to be booted in its bootloader, or *odin*, mode.

The boot image can be installed using the following command, assuming it was
built using the previous command.

 $ result/flash-critical.sh

If you have a system image (`system.img`) built, you can use `heimdall` to
flash it to the device. Note that it might be too big to fit over the `SYSTEM`
partition. In such case, it can be flashed on the `USERDATA` partition.

WARNING: *This will erase everything on the partition*. Additionally, the
common backups methods, e.g. TWRP, will *not* backup the `USERDATA` partition.

 $ heimdall flash --USERDATA system.img
