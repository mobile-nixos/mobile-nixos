== Building and installing

There are multiple installation methods for your _<%= info["fullName"] %>_.
They all rely on flashing one or more partitions on your device.

[WARNING]
====
*All installation methods can lead to data loss.*

Flashing a partition *will erase everything on the partition*. Additionally,
the common backups methods, e.g. TWRP, will *not* backup the `userdata`
partition, which may be the installation target.

Make backups.

=== Using Heimdall

This will produce a folder with a flashing script, and the partition images for
your _<%= info["fullName"] %>_.

 $ nix-build --argstr device <%= info["identifier"] %> -A outputs.android-fastboot-images

Alternatively, you can build a specific partition image:

 $ nix-build --argstr device <%= info["identifier"] %> -A outputs.android-bootimg
 $ nix-build --argstr device <%= info["identifier"] %> -A outputs.rootfs

The device will need to be booted in its bootloader, or *odin*, mode.

The boot images can be installed using the following command, assuming the
`android-fastboot-images` output was used.

 $ result/flash-critical.sh

If you have a system image (`system.img`) built, you can use `heimdall` to
flash it to the device. Note that it might be too big to fit over the `SYSTEM`
partition. In such case, it can be flashed on the `USERDATA` partition.

 $ heimdall flash --USERDATA result/system.img

=== Using a flashable zip

An alternative installation method is to use a flashable zip. The flashable zip
can be built for your _<%= info["fullName"] %>_ using one of the following
commands:

 $ nix-build --argstr device <%= info["identifier"] %> -A outputs.android-flashable-bootimg
 $ nix-build --argstr device <%= info["identifier"] %> -A outputs.android-flashable-system
 $ nix-build --argstr device <%= info["identifier"] %> -A outputs.android-flashable-zip

The first two will flash only a specific partition. The last one contains the
partitions of the two previous one.

The zip can either be copied to the device and selected in a compatible
Android recovery, or sent to the device through `adb sideload`.

 $ adb sideload /nix/store/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-flashable-<%= info["identifier"] %>-boot.zip

By default it will flash to the `system` partition. Some configurations may
change this to flash to the `userdata` partition. In that case, *no warning is
given before flashing*.
